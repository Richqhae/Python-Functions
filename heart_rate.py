# minutes. To find that range, subtract your age from 220. This difference is your maximum heart rate per minute. Your heart
#simply will not beat faster than this maximum (220 - age).When exercising to strengthen your heart, you should keep your heart rate between 65% and 85% of your heartâ€™s maximum rate.#
